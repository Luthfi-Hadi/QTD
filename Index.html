            <h2>💐Hi, Cay!💐</h2>
            <p>Maybe you remember me, or maybe you don’t, but we shared a little moment once.</p>
            <p>It was just a fist bump, a simple touch when you were going out with your friends. But to me, it was so much more than that.</p><br>
            <p>I’m the one who was wearing glasses and a white shirt, just so you know. It may have been just an ordinary moment for you. But for me, someone who has been admiring you from afar for the past month, it was something… extraordinary.</p> <br> 
            <p>I can't lie, that simple moment made my heart feel warm and alive in ways I can't explain. I fell in love with you, right then and there. In that moment, i felt so shy unable to even meet your gaze. That one small moment left me feeling everything all at once, and I couldn’t bring myself to look into your eyes.</p><br>
            <p>And just as the song playing now says, <cite>"Do you think i have forgotten? about you?"</cite> No, I haven’t. That moment will forever linger in my memory. I’m sorry if this seems strange or forward. But right now, this is the only way I can tell you how I feel, and I just couldn’t keep it to myself.</p><br>
            <p>I know I’m just an ordinary guy, not anyone special. But that’s why I made this website just for you, to tell you how I really feel. <cite>Quinnsha Thara Diva</cite>, thank you so much for taking the time to read this message. It truly means the world to me.</p>
